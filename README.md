GCU Senior Capstone Project

Trevor Moore
CST-452

This project is a completely responsive and fully-fledged social media webapp.
It was built using ASP.NET Core 3.1, React, Redux, Material UI, Google OAuth 2.0, and MongoDB.
The cloud of choice was Azure for both hosting and blob storage, and MongoDB Atlas was used for the database.

Future versions of bootleg will include a native iOS mobile app built with Xamarin.iOS.
