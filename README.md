GCU Senior Capstone Project

Trevor Moore
CST-452

This project is a completely responsive and fully-fledged social media webapp.
It was built using ASP.NET Core 3.1, React, Redux, Material UI, and MongoDB.
The cloud of choice was Azure for both hosting and blob storage, and MongoDB Atlas was used for the database.

Future versions of this webapp include a native iOS version built with Xamarin.
